# ml_project
This is an ongoing project to develop my own implementation of different machine learning algorithms

So far I have built the data container structures for storing the various types of training data. The ability to populate the structures from csv files. As well as my own implementation of the ID3 decision tree algorithm.

Next up is neural networks, trained by gradient descent.
